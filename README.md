## Gladiator statistical game: Are you not entertained?!
Given 2 battling factions, each of them have an determined number of warriors. Each warrior has a certain Hit Points. Each battle consists of 1 vs 1 battle between a warrior of each faction. The probability of either warrior winning is the probability of his Hit Points over the sum of both warriors' Hit Points. The winning warrior returns to his faction unscathed and can be readily available for battle. The losing warrior is vanquished and destroyed. The end of the game is when only one faction remains and the other faction is obliterated. What is the optimal strategy if it is known each faction's warrior's Hit Points?  
Hint: Probability of faction winning can be modeled as exponential distribution.
